## Description

The Community Regional Atmospheric Chemistry Multiphase Mechanism (CRACMM) is a description of atmospheric NO<sub>X</sub>-VOC-O<sub>3</sub>-aerosol chemistry and associated metadata (Pye et al., 2023; Place et al., 2023). CRACMM has been available in the EPA [Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) modeling system](https://github.com/USEPA/CMAQ) since version 5.4 (2022 release) and will continue to be updated (see the [EPA fact sheet on the CMAQ website](https://www.epa.gov/cmaq/cracmm)). In CMAQ, CRACMM was initially released with two representations of isoprene chemistry (see Wiser et al., 2023) that were merged together in CRACMM2 (Skipper et al., 2024). The main repository branch on github will evolve (see [Version History](#version-history)) and be periodically tagged to reflect official release versions. To obtain frozen versions of CRACMM, select the appropriate branch or tag on github. 

## Purpose and Organization of the CRACMM Github Repository

The official, frozen versions of CRACMM reside in CMAQ in the [US EPA Github repository](https://github.com/USEPA/CMAQ). Here, we bring together CRACMM metadata from across CMAQ and provide additional information such as how to map emissions to the mechanism. This information is intended to support CMAQ users and provide the atmospheric chemistry community with information about CRACMM. This repository is organized as follows:
 * [Chemistry](chemistry): the mechanism in CMAQ-ready, F0AM box model, and markdown formats
 * [Emissions](emissions): inputs and outputs to emission mapping tools and code to perform mapping of individual species to CRACMM (informed by Foley et al., 2023)
 * [Metadata](metadata): information about CRACMM species (molecular weights, volatility, solubility, representative structures, etc.)
 * [Utilities](utilities): python code to assemble metadata from CMAQ code and routines for screening level predictions of organic aerosol and ozone formation potential
 * [Logos](logos): CRACMM logos designed by Chelsea Thompson at NOAA

## Version history

### Version 2.0-alpha (in progress February 2024)
- Collecting updates leading to CRACMM2 

### Version 1.0 (October 2022)
- Final version for release in CMAQv5.4 
- ROCALK names updated

### Version 0.3
- Renamed HC8 to HC10

- Synced with latest CMAQ version of chemistry and metadata

### Version 0.24 
- Renamed toluene surrogate (explicit) to TOL
- Added flowchart

### Skip v0.23

### Version: 0.22

### Version: 0.21
- This version used to create initial SMOKE inputs.
- Known issues:

### Version: 0.2
Date: 20210716

* PAH eliminated. The most abundant species that was in PAH fit better in the existing oxygenated aromatics. When PAHs were defined with O:C=0, very little mass was left. 
* NAPH includes small amounts of O:C=0 PAHs.
* Propylene glycol (and potential one other species) is now explicit as PROG.
* FURAN has been fully implemented as a species.
* S/IVOCs are now called ROC species. IVOCOXY is now ROCIOXY.
* SVOC ROC binning now occurs before single-ring aromatic mapping.
* ROCP4ARO was eliminated due to lack of significant emissions and OA potential.
* Glycoaldehyde was moved from ALD to GLY to better represent its solubility.
* Silanes and siloxanes of any volatility are ROCIOXY.
* UNKCRACMM is now used for non-carbon-containing species and elemental carbon (and TC).
* DIEN has been deleted. Small amount of anthropogenic dienes appear in FURAN. BDE13 is the major anthropogenic diene and already explicit.
* Some representative compounds (SPECIATE) have been updated: OC, NCOM, POC, PNCOM.
